## Overview

This repository provides an example of Online Parametric Gaussian Process Regression using a 2D toy dataset. The code demonstrates how to generate data, run the main processing script, and create a video from the generated figures.

## Example: 2D Toy Dataset

The provided example focuses on a 2D toy dataset to illustrate the Online Parametric Gaussian Process Regression.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the example:

1. Run the "DataGenerator.py" script to generate the required data.
2. Execute the "Main.py" script for the main processing.
3. After "Main.py" has terminated, you can convert the figures to a video by running the "Image2Video.py" script. Each figure in the video corresponds to a separate stream of data.

## Libraries Used

The example code utilizes the following libraries:

- `pip install autograd`
- `pip install scikit-learn`
- `pip install matplotlib`
- `pip install pandas`
- `pip install pyDOE`
- `pip install opencv-python`
- `pip install natsort`

Make sure to have these libraries installed to run the code successfully.
